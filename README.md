# EdgeVision
Real-time Android edge-detection app using Camera2, OpenCV C++ (NDK), JNI, and OpenGL ES 2.0. Captures camera frames, processes them natively with Canny/Grayscale, and renders results as GL textures. Includes modular native pipeline and a TypeScript web viewer for displaying sample processed frames with FPS and resolution overlays.
